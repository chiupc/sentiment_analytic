NIT,1614686740,US,"“NIO concluded a transformational 2020 with a new quarterly delivery record of 17,353 vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2020. The strong momentum has continued in 2021 as we achieved a historic monthly delivery of 7,225 vehicles in January and a resilient delivery of 5,578 vehicles in February, representing strong 352% and 689% year-over-year growth, respectively,” said William Bin Li, founder, chairman and chief executive officer of NIO. “Supported by competitive product offerings, outstanding services and innovative business models, we have won increasingly encouraging recognition from our users and expect to deliver 20,000 to 20,500 vehicles in the first quarter of 2021.” “At our fourth NIO Day on January 9, 2021, we launched the ET7, our first flagship sedan. Boosted by its class-leading dimensions, sophisticated design, superior driving performance and industry-leading AD capabilities, ET7 has received remarkable feedback from users, media and the industry. ET7 is also equipped with NIO’s latest inhouse full stack NIO Autonomous Driving (NAD) powered by NIO Aquila Super Sensing and NIO Adam Super Computing. NAD will be offered through a monthly subscription service, or AD as a Service (ADaaS). We owe our achievements in 2020 to our loyal and supportive user community and will stay committed to our vision of building a community starting with smart EVs where we share joy and grow together with users,” concluded Mr. Li."

nasti,1614686354,US,"Hard-driving Chinese electric vehicle (EV) company NIO (NYSE:NIO) decelerated in evening trading Monday, following the release of its Q4 2020 results after market close.

ximenezxim,1614686345,US,"Nobody knows if NIO sold any car of those sports cars he launched in 2014 when it entered the market. Then in the space of 3 years ES 6 and ES8 models were launched to the chinese market sales wise was an unmitigated disaster due to the high costs involved in the production reflected in the final price of acquisition .$400 million were lost in just in the third Q from launching, the company had run out of money and only a political phone call from his CEO. was able to save the company from disaster after reference investors had flee the company. The chinese goverment save Nio´s furniture through an $1 billion injection and that is what  I know from Nio to cut a story short. Technologically the future of NIO is quite difficult and the EV. war frontline very competitive as there are at least two more chinese EV , there is Germany , Ford and Apple doing their own autonomous driving high technics . All by all I wouldn´t buy a Nio´s single share for more than $20 after having seen this late earnings."
hindman,1614686318,US,"Chinese electric car start-up Nio said Tuesday a shortage in semiconductors and batteries will cut its production capacity in the second quarter to 7,500 vehicles a month, down from 10,000. Shares of New York-listed Nio fell 4% in extended-hours trading after reporting a fourth-quarter earnings loss of 14 cents a share.I have found this site helpful when trading stocks like NIO. https://daytradingsquad.team/Real-Time-Trade-Alerts"
ghita,1614686258,US,"„  I mentioned because of the constraints of the chipset supply and the battery supply, in the second quarter we may only be able to secure overall supply chain production capacity of 7,500 units per month. But starting from July, we expect to elevate the overall supply chain production capacity. And just like I mentioned before, our partner, JAC has already kicked off their further production capacity expansion. So it means that probably the annual production capacity is going to reach 150,000 units under one shift and 300,000 units under two shifts by the end of this year or the beginning of next year.“"
